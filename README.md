# python-footguns

A collection of guns that I've incautiously discharged.

- implicit relative imports
- mutable default keyword arguments
- mutable objects in the module namespace
- oops I've uploaded my home directory to PyPI
- forgot to add an `__init__.py` (PEP 420)
- `pathlib.Path` is not JSON serializable
- `collections.defaultdict` doesn't quack like a duck
- string interpolation may had side effects
- ...more TBD
